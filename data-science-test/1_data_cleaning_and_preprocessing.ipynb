    "\n",
    "In this test, the `requests` datasets contains information about the requests made by group of individuals (or family) to the french emergency housing public service. A sample of the `requests` dataset corresponds to a unique request. The `individuals` datasets contains information about each individual for all requests.\n",
    "You can use the column `request_id` to link the two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the categorical variable `granted_number_of_nights` which represents the number of nights of emergency housing granted to a group. You can train your model on the `requests_train`, the predictions should be made for requests listed in the `requests_test` dataset. The competition score should also be computed on the `requests_test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric is given by the `competition_scorer` defined above. It corresponds to a weighted log-loss with weights 1, 10, 100, or 1000 if the `granted_number_of_nights` takes the value 0, 1, 2, or 3 respectively. Thus beware that you will be penalized harder for classification mistakes made on the higher labels.\n",

    "The score for a random prediction is shown at the end of this notebook (~1.6), your trained models should at least reach a **score below 1** to be significantly better.\n",
